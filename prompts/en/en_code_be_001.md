Write a single-file Node.js HTTP server named `server.js`. Use only built-in Node.js modules; no Express, no npm packages. Keep the code under 1,000 lines.

Task: implement a small JSON API for a help-desk ticket queue stored in a local JSON file.

Data model:
- Ticket: `id`, `subject`, `description`, `priority` (`low`, `medium`, `high`), `status` (`open`, `in_progress`, `resolved`), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

API requirements:
1. `GET /tickets` with optional query params `status` and `priority`.
2. `POST /tickets` to create a ticket. Validate required fields.
3. `GET /tickets/{id}` to fetch one ticket.
4. `PATCH /tickets/{id}` to update `subject`, `description`, `priority`, or `status`.
5. `DELETE /tickets/{id}` to delete a ticket.
6. `GET /metrics` returning counts by status and priority plus average age of open tickets in seconds.

Engineering requirements:
- Read/write a `tickets.json` file safely enough for sequential requests.
- Return JSON for all responses, including errors.
- Include CORS headers for local browser testing.
- Handle invalid JSON, unknown routes, unsupported methods, and missing IDs.
- Start on `127.0.0.1:8080` by default.

Output only the complete JavaScript code. Do not include explanations.
